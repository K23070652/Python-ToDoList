# Python-ToDoList App

This is a personal project of mine where I have made a simple To-Do List App using Python and Streamlit. The app allows users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, and clear the entire task list. Each task is stored in a CSV file as it is added.

## Usage
To use the To-Do List application, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install streamlit
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd to-do-list
   ```

4. Run the application using Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

5. A web app will open in your browser, displaying the To-Do List interface.
